# GitHub Copilot Instructions for rust\_js\_parser

This file provides guidance on how to assist with the `rust_js_parser` project.

## Project Overview

The goal of the `rust_js_parser` project is to create a runtime JavaScript interpreter and parser capable of server-side rendering (SSR) for JavaScript and React applications, specifically leveraging the Actix-web framework.

## Key Features

* **Parser**: Develop a robust JavaScript parser capable of accurately interpreting modern JavaScript syntax.
* **Interpreter**: Implement a JavaScript interpreter that can execute parsed JavaScript code at runtime.
* **Server-side Rendering**: Enable efficient and effective server-side rendering for JavaScript applications, enhancing SEO and performance.
* **React Support**: Ensure full compatibility and seamless integration for rendering React components server-side.
* **Actix-web Integration**: Integrate seamlessly with the Actix-web framework to facilitate performant and scalable web applications built with Rust.

## Copilot Assistance

GitHub Copilot should:

* Provide accurate and idiomatic Rust code suggestions to implement the parser and interpreter.
* Suggest efficient solutions for server-side rendering processes, especially for React components.
* Recommend best practices for integrating JavaScript execution within Actix-web routes and handlers.
* Assist in debugging by suggesting code snippets for error handling and logging.
* Encourage clean, maintainable, and performant Rust coding standards throughout the development process.
